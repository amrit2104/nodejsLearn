REST API - WILL SUPPORT JSON DATA

We used mockaroo.com to generate fake json data to work.

GET /users - List all users 
1. GET /users - HTML Doc Render - DONE
2. GET/api/users - List all users JSON - DONE
GET /api/users/1 - Get the user with ID 1 - DONE
GET /api/users/2 - Get the user with ID 2 - DONE

1 & 2 are dynamic path parameters
GET /api/users/:id 
:id -> Variable - DONE

POST /api/users - Create new user
-> Browsers by default they do get request.

PATCH /api/users/1 - Edit the user with ID 1
Used PUT to patch and edit data in user with id 1 - DONE

DELETE /api/users/1 - Delete the user with ID 1 - DONE

All the above tasks are implemented and completed.
